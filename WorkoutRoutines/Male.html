            If you are at beginner stage and want to gain muscle, one of the best body part splits you can use to
            accomplish
            this is the push/pull/legs split routine.

            The push/pull/legs split is one of the simplest, most enduring and popular workout routines. And it’s
            also extremely effective; assuming that it’s done right.
        </p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">What Is The Push/Pull/Legs Split Routine?</span></strong></p>
        <p><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 12pt;">The push/pull/legs split is a very simple training method in
                which
                you split your body into three parts. And each part is then trained on its own separate day.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 12pt;">In the "push" workout you train all the upper body
                pushing muscles, i.e. the chest, shoulders and triceps.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 12pt;">In the "pull" workout you train all the upper body
                pulling muscles, i.e. the back and biceps.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 12pt;">And in the "legs" workout you train the entire
                lower
                body, i.e. the quads, hamstrings, calves and abdominals.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 12pt;">These three workouts are then alternated over
                however
                many weekly training sessions you choose to do.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 12pt;">So for instance if you can only make it to the gym three
                days
                per week, you would simply do each workout on its own set day once each week, e.g. Monday, Wednesday and
                Friday. However this is not the best way to do it as it means that each body part is only being trained
                once
                per week, and as I've said previously this is not optimal for muscle growth (though it's
                fine
                for a maintenance program).</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 12pt;">So a better way would be to train four days per week,
                alternating
                the workouts over your four training sessions. It doesn't matter which days you choose as long as
                you
                never do more than two days in a row.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 12pt;">Another method is the rotating five day cycle, where each
                workout
                is done over a five day period. So this means you would train 2 on, 1 off, 1 on, 1 off and then repeat.
                This
                is probably the best way to do it as it means that each body part is trained once every 5 days -
                and
                this is about ideal for the more experienced trainee. But it does mean that your training days are
                constantly changing so you need a fairly flexible schedule for this to work.</span></p>
        <p><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Why Use A Push/Pull/Legs Split?</span></strong></p>
        <p><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 12pt;">The push/pull/legs split is probably the most efficient
                workout
                split there is because all related muscle groups are trained together in the same workout.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 12pt;">This means that you get the maximum overlap of movements
                within
                the same workout, and the muscle groups being trained get an overall benefit from this overlap.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 12pt;">For example when you train chest with say bench press, you are
                also hitting your anterior deltoids and triceps hard. And when you train shoulders you are again
                involving
                your triceps. So it makes sense to work these all together in the same workout for maximum synergy and
                effectiveness.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 12pt;">Similarly when you train your back your biceps are heavily
                involved, so it again makes sense to train these immediately afterwards so that they can derive the
                maximum
                benefit from the additional stimulation.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 12pt;">It also means you will have minimum overlap of movements
                between
                workouts, and this will facilitate better recovery than most other body part splits.</span></p>
        <p><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Who Should Use A Push/Pull/Legs Split?</span></strong></p>
        <p><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 12pt;">The push/pull/legs split is ideal for both the intermediate
                and
                advanced trainee.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 12pt;">More specifically though, if you are just starting out or have
                not
                had much in the way of results from your efforts so far, you'll almost certainly do best with a
                full
                body workout routine, training three days per week. Stick with this for at least six months - more
                if
                you are still progressing well.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 12pt;">Once you hit the intermediate stage however you'll
                probably
                find you'll do better with an upper/lower split routine training three or four days per week. And
                this
                is in fact one of the best ways to train for the vast majority of the population.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 12pt;">But at any time past the beginner stage you may find the
                push/pull/legs split suits you better. Or you may wish to alternate upper/lower splits with a
                push/pull/legs
                split in order to derive all the benefits that each has to offer.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 12pt;">Either way the push/pull/legs split is an extremely effective
                method of training that is certain to give you exceptional results if you apply yourself to it
                diligently.</span></p>


        <p><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 100px; margin-bottom: 40px;">The sets listed in
                below
                routine are your work sets. Always warm up properly first
                in order to prepare your body for the heavier work, and to help prevent injury. However another
                advantage of
                this split routine is that fewer warm-up sets are required as training each exercise/body part warms you
                up
                for the next.</span></p>

        <h2 style="margin-left: 70px;"><strong>What is cardio?</strong></h2>
        <p>The word cardio originated from the Greek word ‘Kardia’ which means heart. Cardio exercise is any exercise or
            physical activity that increases our heart rate. This form of exercise improves the functioning of our
            heart, lungs and circulatory system.
        </p>
        <p>Most of us understand that to keep our muscles in working order, we need to move them. This movement makes
            our
            muscles stronger and, thus, more efficient in keeping us healthy. Since our heart, is also a muscle, it
            requires
            a workout so that it gets stronger and the capillaries deliver more oxygen to cells of our muscles. This
            helps
            our body to burn more fat during both activity and inactivity.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <h3>What are the benefits of cardio?</h3>
        <p>One of the first steps in building a healthy lifestyle is to include some form of cardio exercise into your
            routine. It is without a doubt one of the healthiest activities you'll do in a day, almost like
            brushing
            your teeth or sleeping 8 hours. Through regular cardio, your heart and lung function better, both during
            exercise and at rest.</p>
        <p>Improves heart health – First and foremost benefit of cardio exercises has to be heart
            health. This form of exercise is usually recommended by doctors to patients with risk of heart illnesses as
            it
            makes the heart stronger and improves its efficiency of pumping blood throughout the body. It also improves
            your
            resting heart rate, thereby reducing the stress on your most vital muscle.</p>
        <p>Weight loss – Cardio plays an essential part in burning calories. While crash dieting can
            help in losing weight faster, but, it is not sustainable in the
            long run. With regular cardio exercise and clean eating, you will see and feel the difference in your
            fitness.
            Including some strength training to this can be even more beneficial.</p>
        <p>Lowers blood pressure – Cardio exercises may help you manage your blood pressure
            symptoms. It happens because physical activity helps in lowering the blood pressure thereby reducing high
            blood
            pressure.</p>
        <p>Reduces chronic pain – Chronic pains like back pain may be reduced with the help of low
            impact cardio exercise. Weight loss can further help in relieving your joint pains, as it relieves the
            stress on
            the joints carrying all the extra weight.</p>
        <p>Improves sleep – Cardio exercise may help you sleep better. During a workout, your body
            expends a lot of energy and thus,
            needs rest to recover for the next routine. In simple words, exercising everyday tires you out, so you are
            able
            to sleep better.</p>
        <p>Strengths immune system – Cardio exercises improve certain antibodies in the blood called
            immunoglobulins which helps in strengthening the immune system. With a healthy immune system, your body’s
            strength to fight the illnesses will improve.</p>

        <h4><b>How to choose a cardio exercise?</b></h4>
        <p>Once you've decided that you want to work out to have a healthy body, the next step is to choose a
            routine among the many available. A significant factor in choosing an exercise is doing something you enjoy.
            This will also help you maintain the habit in the long run. If you like the outdoors, you can go for a run
            or go cycling. And if you prefer staying indoors, you can try at-home exercises or consider joining a gym.
        </p>
        <p>What you need to focus on is an exercise that makes your heart beat fast, no matter if it is indoors or
            outdoors. Some things to keep in mind while choosing a cardio exercise.</p>
        <p><b>‘Best’ cardio </b>– There is nothing like the 'best' cardio routine. As said
            above, any exercise that increases your heart beat rate is good for you. There are a lot of exercises that
            come under the category of cardio but each one is good for a specific reason and you need to look at your
            own needs and lifestyle to determine what's best for you. If you are someone who enjoys the
            environment and likes to spend time outdoors, running and cycling can be a good form of cardio. If on the
            other hand, you are more comfortable indoors in your own privacy, at-home exercises like jogging in place,
            jumping jacks, skipping will be a great option.</p>
        <p><b>Quantity over quality</b> – People tend to focus on the number of reps they do of an
            exercise. But what actually matters is the quality of those reps. For example, if you are targeting your
            abdomen muscles by doing
            crunches, you should focus on your form and posture instead of the number of crunches your perform. The
            better your posture will be the better will be the results. 100 crunches with incorrect form will not give
            much benefit. Additionally, incorrect form and poor alignment may result in injuries.</p>
        <p><b>Do what you like</b> – The most important point for adopting any workout routine is that
            it should not be forced. Rather, it should be something that you enjoy doing. Do not start working out
            because someone passed a negative comment about your weight. Work out because ‘you’ want to work out. Work
            out because ‘you’ want to be happy. Having a positive association with exercising is going to help you
            continue with it for a lifetime. If you do not like going to the gym then try at-home exercises or if you
            like outdoor environment then go for a run. But always do what makes you happy.</p>
        <p><b>Be flexible </b>– Don't make a single exercise routine and follow it every day
            without alterations. For any workout routine to be effective, it is essential to include a variety of
            exercises. Another way to do this is to target a specific set of muscles every day. If one day you have
            targeted your leg muscles, the second day target your back muscles. By adding a variety of exercises you
            maintain interest in the workout and also give enough time for each set of muscles to recuperate. Some days
            you can even ditch the exercise and maybe dance or play a sport. Be flexible and do whatever you like, the
            idea is to do a healthy activity that gets your heart pumping.</p>
