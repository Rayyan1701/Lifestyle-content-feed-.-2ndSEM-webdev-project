            </h1>

            <p>Men, it seems, are not the only ones who enjoy lifting weights. Nowadays, you're just as likely to see
                women in the gym,
                squatting, benching, and deadlifting. The 'Girls that lift' movement is now very much
                established, and we think that's awesome.
            <p>Years ago, if you walked into a gym, more often than not, the sight you would be greeted with would be a
                weight room full of men, and a cardio room full of women. Women were generally advised to stay away from
                weights as it was wrongly believed that lifting weights would turn them into hulking she-beasts.</p>
            <p>As research was conducted, and as common sense began to prevail, people found that lifting weights as a woman
                would not cause you to add 50 pounds of muscle to your frame overnight. In fact, it was found that
                resistance training provided a shapelier, curvier, leaner, more defined physique than one which could be
                attained through cardio alone.</p>
            <p>That's why today, we are going to be looking at a 5 day workout routine for women to get strong and
                toned.</p>
            <p>If you're a woman who is looking to get bigger, stronger, and more toned, the following routine is
                perfect.</p>
    
            <h2 id="warming-up">Warming Up</h2>
            <p>
                Before you commit to any form of workout routine, it is absolutely vital that you take the time to properly
                warm up before training.</p>
            <p>Warming up before training is important because it <strong>helps improve your flexibility and
                    mobility</strong>, and helps reduce the risk of injury. By stretching the muscles before training, you
                help to increase muscle fiber elasticity. This is important because it
                means that the muscle fibers are far less-likely to rip and tear.
    
    
            </p>
            <p>A good warm up will also <strong>increase your core body temperature</strong> and will potentially
                <strong>improve your athletic performance</strong>. Warming up boosts circulation, which in turn means
                more blood flows around the body. This ensures that more oxygen and nutrients can be carried around the
                body and be fed to the awaiting muscle cells. The more energy they have, the harder the muscles can work
                when you're training.
            </p>
            <p>Simply doing a few reps with just the bar, or a very light set of dumbbells, does not constitute as an
                effective warmup.
            </p>
            <h3 >Sample Warm Up Routine</h3>
            <p>
                Let's look at how you can warm up properly to get the most from your training.</p>
            <p>A sample warmup routine could consist of the following exercises and movements:
            </p>
            <ol class="textcontent" style="margin-left: 160px;">
                <li>1 minute of knee lift</li>
                <li>1 minute of heel dig</li>
                <li>2 sets of 10 shoulder rolls per arm</li>
                <li>10 knee bend</li>
                <li>20 head rotations</li>
                <li>10 hip rotations</li>
    
    
            </ol>
            <h2 >5 Day Workout Routine for Women to Get Strong
                and Toned</h2>
            <p>
                Now let's take a look at the ultimate 5-day workout routine for women to get strong and toned. If
                followed correctly, you should start seeing and feeling noticeable improvements on a weekly basis.</p>
            <p>The idea here is to build lean muscle while keeping calorie expenditure high to melt away stubborn body fat
                in the process

            <h2 style="margin-left: 70px;"><strong>What is cardio?</strong></h2>
            <p>The word cardio originated from the Greek word ‘Kardia’ which means heart. Cardio exercise is any exercise or
                physical activity that increases our heart rate. This form of exercise improves the functioning of our
                heart, lungs and circulatory system.
            </p>
            <p>Most of us understand that to keep our muscles in working order, we need to move them. This movement makes
                our
                muscles stronger and, thus, more efficient in keeping us healthy. Since our heart, is also a muscle, it
                requires
                a workout so that it gets stronger and the capillaries deliver more oxygen to cells of our muscles. This
                helps
                our body to burn more fat during both activity and inactivity.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3>What are the benefits of cardio?</h3>
            <p>One of the first steps in building a healthy lifestyle is to include some form of cardio exercise into your
                routine. It is without a doubt one of the healthiest activities you&#8217;ll do in a day, almost like
                brushing
                your teeth or sleeping 8 hours. Through regular cardio, your heart and lung function better, both during
                exercise and at rest.</p>
            <p>Improves heart health – First and foremost benefit of cardio exercises has to be heart
                health. This form of exercise is usually recommended by doctors to patients with risk of heart illnesses as
                it
                makes the heart stronger and improves its efficiency of pumping blood throughout the body. It also improves
                your
                resting heart rate, thereby reducing the stress on your most vital muscle.</p>
            <p>Weight loss – Cardio plays an essential part in burning calories. While crash dieting can
                help in losing weight faster, but, it is not sustainable in the
                long run. With regular cardio exercise and clean eating, you will see and feel the difference in your
                fitness.
                Including some strength training to this can be even more beneficial.</p>
            <p>Lowers blood pressure – Cardio exercises may help you manage your blood pressure
                symptoms. It happens because physical activity helps in lowering the blood pressure thereby reducing high
                blood
                pressure.</p>
            <p>Reduces chronic pain – Chronic pains like back pain may be reduced with the help of low
                impact cardio exercise. Weight loss can further help in relieving your joint pains, as it relieves the
                stress on
                the joints carrying all the extra weight.</p>
            <p>Improves sleep – Cardio exercise may help you sleep better. During a workout, your body
                expends a lot of energy and thus,
                needs rest to recover for the next routine. In simple words, exercising everyday tires you out, so you are
                able
                to sleep better.</p>
            <p>Strengths immune system – Cardio exercises improve certain antibodies in the blood called
                immunoglobulins which helps in strengthening the immune system. With a healthy immune system, your body’s
                strength to fight the illnesses will improve.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
            <h4><b>How to choose a cardio exercise?</b></h4>
            <p>Once you&#8217;ve decided that you want to work out to have a healthy body, the next step is to choose a
                routine among the many available. A significant factor in choosing an exercise is doing something you enjoy.
                This will also help you maintain the habit in the long run. If you like the outdoors, you can go for a run
                or go cycling. And if you prefer staying indoors, you can try at-home exercises or consider joining a gym.
            </p>
            <p>What you need to focus on is an exercise that makes your heart beat fast, no matter if it is indoors or
                outdoors. Some things to keep in mind while choosing a cardio exercise.</p>
            <p><b>‘Best’ cardio </b>– There is nothing like the &#8220;best&#8221; cardio routine. As said
                above, any exercise that increases your heart beat rate is good for you. There are a lot of exercises that
                come under the category of cardio but each one is good for a specific reason and you need to look at your
                own needs and lifestyle to determine what&#8217;s best for you. If you are someone who enjoys the
                environment and likes to spend time outdoors, running and cycling can be a good form of cardio. If on the
                other hand, you are more comfortable indoors in your own privacy, at-home exercises like jogging in place,
                jumping jacks, skipping will be a great option.</p>
            <p><b>Quantity over quality</b> – People tend to focus on the number of reps they do of an
                exercise. But what actually matters is the quality of those reps. For example, if you are targeting your
                abdomen muscles by doing
                crunches, you should focus on your form and posture instead of the number of crunches your perform. The
                better your posture will be the better will be the results. 100 crunches with incorrect form will not give
                much benefit. Additionally, incorrect form and poor alignment may result in injuries.</p>
            <p><b>Do what you like</b> – The most important point for adopting any workout routine is that
                it should not be forced. Rather, it should be something that you enjoy doing. Do not start working out
                because someone passed a negative comment about your weight. Work out because ‘you’ want to work out. Work
                out because ‘you’ want to be happy. Having a positive association with exercising is going to help you
                continue with it for a lifetime. If you do not like going to the gym then try at-home exercises or if you
                like outdoor environment then go for a run. But always do what makes you happy.</p>
            <p><b>Be flexible </b>– Don&#8217;t make a single exercise routine and follow it every day
                without alterations. For any workout routine to be effective, it is essential to include a variety of
                exercises. Another way to do this is to target a specific set of muscles every day. If one day you have
                targeted your leg muscles, the second day target your back muscles. By adding a variety of exercises you
                maintain interest in the workout and also give enough time for each set of muscles to recuperate. Some days
                you can even ditch the exercise and maybe dance or play a sport. Be flexible and do whatever you like, the
                idea is to do a healthy activity that gets your heart pumping.</p>
